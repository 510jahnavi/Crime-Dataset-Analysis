# Crime-Dataset-Analysis

The main objective of crime analysis is to aid the functioning of a police department, which 
encompasses tasks such as facilitating criminal investigations, apprehending and prosecuting 
offenders, enhancing patrol operations, implementing crime prevention and reduction tactics, 
and promoting problem-solving initiatives. Crime analysts provide essential insights to law 
enforcement agencies, improving their efficiency in crime reduction. They also aid law 
enforcement executives in making well-informed decisions concerning resource distribution, 
personnel placement, and strategic planning.

This investigative report aims to comprehensively analyze crime data. It begins by calculating 
and visualizing annual crime trends, followed by a monthly analysis of average crime 
occurrences over the years. The investigation identifies the most frequent crime type and 
compares crime rates between regions or cities using descriptive statistics and visualizations. 
Furthermore, it incorporates economic data to assess the correlation between economic factors 
and crime rates. Weekly crime frequencies are analyzed based on the day of the week, and 
significant events or policy changes during the dataset period are explored for their impact on 
crime rates. The report employs statistical methods and data visualization techniques to identify 
outliers and unusual patterns in the dataset. It also examines potential patterns and correlations 
between demographic factors and specific crime types. Finally, time series forecasting methods, 
such as ARIMA or Prophet, are utilized to predict future crime trends, with an emphasis on 
incorporating relevant external factors into the forecasting models.In this project, we have used 
Python and Jupyter notebook to clean the crime dataset from 2020 to present that we got from
catalog.data.gov.
